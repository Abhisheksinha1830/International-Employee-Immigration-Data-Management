# International Employee Immigration Data Management

The main goal of this study was to devise and deploy a practical relational database tailored for use in the
International Employee Immigration domain, addressing the persistent challenges faced by companies in this
industry. These companies have consistently voiced concerns about the laborious nature of the mandatory
international employee data input procedures mandated by law. Upon a comprehensive examination of the
industry-wide issue, it became evident that there was substantial data redundancy, presenting an opportunity for
efficiency through data reuse facilitated by a relational database.
The implementation of this relational database has demonstrated a 50% reduction in the time required for the
data input process, yielding significant cost savings across the entire industry. Additionally, the database
incorporates a central analytics platform with extensive potential for analyzing employee information, studying
citizenship patterns, and streamlining data management.
The database design considered the specific data fields mandated by the United States Citizenship and
Immigration Services for VISA and Green Card renewal processes. Extensive Entity-Relationship (EER) and
Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams were crafted, followed by the translation of the conceptual model
into a relational model, complete with the necessary primary and foreign keys. The full implementation of this
database was executed using MySQL, with a prototype adapted for MongoDB to explore the feasibility of
employing this database in a NoSQL environment.
The resulting database has proven to be highly successful. Integration with Python has unlocked expansive
analytics capabilities, some of which are showcased in the study. These analytical queries can be instrumental in
monitoring and managing employees effectively. The subsequent phase of enhancement for this SQL Database
involves the incorporation of Data Governance measures. Following this, the project aims to be presented to
U.S. companies seeking simplified solutions for international employee management processes.
